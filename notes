Ideas:

- About 10 agents
- About 4/5 items
- Assume special case(s) of polynomial time computability - hierarchical, pairs/beachfront (not too complex)
- First price for WDP
- Hardcode the valuation functions for individual agents - we're comparing results, not creating them
- Strategies will prolly be the hardest part
- Derek is a bully
- HI derek
