Ideas:

- About 10 agents
- About 4/5 items
- Assume special case(s) of polynomial time computability - hierarchical, pairs/beachfront (not too complex)
- First price for WDP
- Hardcode the valuation functions for individual agents - we're comparing results, not creating them
- Strategies will prolly be the hardest part


Todo: 
- Start with representation of values OR*, OR, XOR, etc.
- Special index for dummy variable 
- Approach WDP, building as hierarchical model
  - Steps outlined in that one pset 
- Auction platform figures out prices
- Stats --> utilities to everyone 

How to Represent Bids/WDP
- A bid looks like [(id, [list_of_items], bid), ...], with the bid representing your value on that combo.
- The list_of_items can include dummy items (OR*)

- The WDP concatenates all these bids into one array
- Then, carry out the dynamic programming example - we have hierarchical bids
